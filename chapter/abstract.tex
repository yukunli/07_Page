水分的准确测量对很多生产领域的生产过程具有重要意义。在众多水分检测方法中，近红外水分检测凭借连续在线、非接触测量、响应速度快等优点，在很多领域得到了广泛的应用。当前基于近红外吸收光谱的传统近红外水分仪通过切光盘对大功率卤素灯光源进行调制，具有功耗大、可动部件多、调制频率受机械转速限制等不足，影响了仪器的测量精度、稳定性和使用寿命。

本课题研制了应用于烧结矿生产过程中烧结混合料水分测量的近红外水分测量系统。针对传统的近红外水分测量仪的不足之处，本课题采用红外~LED~光源代替传统光源，电调制光信号取代机械调制的新型近红外水分检测方案。在充分了解前人研究工作的基础上，本文研究了微弱信号处理技术，提出采用数字锁相放大器对光电探测器接收到的信号进行处理。与模拟锁相放大器相比，数字锁相放大器不仅极大简化了电路设计，而且有效提高了信噪改善比。此外，本文对前置放大电路、滤波电路等模拟信号处理电路进行了优化，设计了频率可调、电流稳定的光源信号驱动电路和基于~DSP~处理器的信号检测电路。在搭建了近红外水分测量系统硬件平台的同时，本文编写了基于~DSP~处理器的数字信号处理程序以及串口触摸屏人机交互程序。

The moisture of materials is an important parameter during the production process in many fields. It is significant to detect the moisture of materials quickly and precisely. With the feature of non-contact, continuation and fast measure speed, the method of near-infrared detection has been widely applied to many fields in moisture detection. There are moving parts in traditional near-infrared moisture meter, which influence accuracy and stability of measurement by its machinery rotation, power consumption and volume of the equipment is larger as well.

A new near-infrared moisture detection scheme without moving parts was proposed in this thesis, which against the disadvantages of traditional near-infrared moisture measurement instrument. Traditional high power light source was replaced by near-infrared LED, while mechanical modulation was replaced by electrical modulation. Useful signal drowning in strong noise background can be extracted by phase-lock amplifier technology. The main content in this thesis reads as follows:

(1) The theory of near-infrared moisture detection has been studied, including near-infrared spectral analysis theory, diffuse quantitative analysis theory and the principle of three wavelength measurement. Phase-lock amplifier technology has been researched and applied to detect the weake signal.

(2) Optical system of the near-infrared moisture meter was designed and simulated by LightTools. The optimal designing scheme of optical system was chosen after comparison and analysis.

(3) Hardware circuit of moisture meter was designed and made to entity, which including power circuit, light source driving circuit, signal processing circuit and digital circuit.

(4) The microcontroller procedures of near-infrared moisture meter was writed by C language, The PC software was completed in the LabVIEW development environment.

(5) The best measuring distance experiment, moisture meter calibration experiment, repetitive experiment and stability experiment was conducted by near-infrared moisture meter under laboratory conditions, which taking sinter mixture as moisture detection object. The results show that the best measuring distance was 0~150mm. Absolute variation in stability experiment was within 0.31\% moisture content while measuring sinter mixture of 3\%~8\% water content. Relative standard deviation in repetitive experiment was 2.14\%. Measuring error of this instrument was under 0.34\%moisture content.
